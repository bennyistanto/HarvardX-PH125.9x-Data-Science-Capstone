# Vegetation Response Capstone Project

This folder contains the required files for the **Vegetation Response Capstone Project** for the HarvardX Professional Data Science program. The project focuses on predicting vegetation health (NDVI) in response to rainfall using various models, including Random Forest, Linear Regression, and ARIMAX. The models are evaluated based on their performance using metrics such as **RMSE** and **MAE**, with additional visualizations provided to understand the model predictions.

## Files

- **BI_VegetationResponse_Project_HarvardX_Ph125_9x.Rmd**: The R Markdown file containing the full report, analysis, code, and visualizations for predicting NDVI using rainfall data.
- **BI_VegetationResponse_Project_HarvardX_Ph125_9x.pdf**: The PDF version of the report generated from the Rmd file.
- **BI_VegetationResponse_Project_HarvardX_Ph125_9x.R**: The R script containing the code used for model predictions and evaluation.
