# HarvardX PH125.9x Data Science Capstone
Capstone Project of HarvardX Professional Data Science

This repository contains my capstone projects for the HarvardX Professional Data Science program. The folder structure is as follows:

- **MovieLens**: This folder contains the files for the MovieLens Capstone Project, which is a mandatory component of the program.
- **[Other Project]**: (To be added later) This folder will contain another capstone project based on user data.

## Folders

### `MovieLens`
The **MovieLens** folder includes the Rmd, PDF, and R script files for the MovieLens Capstone Project, along with a detailed report on the analysis and modeling of the MovieLens dataset. The project implements multiple models to predict movie ratings and evaluate the performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

### `[Other Project]`
A placeholder for the second project, which will use user-provided data for analysis. The project specifics will be added once the data and methodology are finalized.
