# HarvardX PH125.9x Data Science Capstone
Capstone Projects of the HarvardX Professional Data Science Program

This repository contains my capstone projects for the HarvardX Professional Data Science program. The folder structure is as follows:

- **MovieLens**: Contains files for the MovieLens Capstone Project, a mandatory component of the program.
- **VegetationResponse**: Contains files for the Vegetation Response Capstone Project, which focuses on predicting vegetation health (NDVI) based on rainfall data using various machine learning models.

## Folders

### `MovieLens`
The **MovieLens** folder includes the Rmd, PDF, and R script files for the MovieLens Capstone Project. This project analyzes and models the MovieLens dataset using multiple techniques to predict movie ratings. The evaluation metric used is RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

### `VegetationResponse`
The **VegetationResponse** folder contains the Rmd, PDF, and R script files for the Vegetation Response Capstone Project. This project aims to predict **NDVI** (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) using rainfall data and evaluates model performance based on **RMSE** and **MAE**. The analysis includes models like Random Forest, Linear Regression, and ARIMAX, with visualizations that help interpret the results.
